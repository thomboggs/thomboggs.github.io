# Coding

## Fractal Factory

I have two versions of this fun little project, one written using Qt and one written using JUCE. The JUCE version is newer and still being worked on, while the Qt project is older and written in a style that I've grown away from.

## Bass Preamp Plugin

This was a plugin I started to create before I joined iZotope. The goal was to take what I learned from making the multiband EQ from ProgrammingForMusicians and make a simple "amp simulator" using stock DSP in JUCE. Combine a compressor, EQ, and gain to have something to plug my bass into. 

## Elev8r iOS app

An iOS to guide you through an "Emotional Elevator", which is a strategy to feel through tough emotions to find a core insecurity and reframe the belief to overcome emotional blocks. It uses CoreData to store your conversations to your device. Current status is basically demo-MVP. I need to work more on this as there are a lot of features and utilities to be gained from this.
