My name is Thomas, an audio software developer and musician living in Rockland, Maine. I'm passionate about learning, technology, and music. For the past three years combining the latter two to create audio software that makes the world a more creative place. 

I'm currently working at iZotope (or Native Instruments, depending on if you wanna talk about the brand or the company), and I'm the tech lead for one of the Music-focused product groups.

Things that I worked significantly on:
- [Izotope Ozone 10 and 11](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/ozone.html)
- [Izotope RX 11](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/rx.html)
- [Izotope Plasma](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/plasma.html)
- [Izotope Aurora](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/aurora.html)
