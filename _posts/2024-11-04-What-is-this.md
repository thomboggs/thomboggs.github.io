# "What's the point of this site?"

I'm nearly three years into my audio programming journey, and I've accomplished a lot. 

1. Great products made
    1. Ozone 10
    2. Ozone 11
    3. RX 11
    4. Plasma
    5. Aurora
    6. (Secret others.....)
2. Worked with fantastic, incredible talented coworkers
3. "Promoted" to tech lead after 2.5 years as a software engineer
4. Got to work "remote" and move to Mid-coast Maine

I feel like I'm at a part of my career in which I want to keep growing technically. Even though I've been an engineer for more than a decade, I still feel like a baby software engineer. I'm still finding my footing, discovering what interests me, and making beginner mistakes. I've had to grow fairly quickly as an engineering leader to adapt to this Tech lead role, but I don't want to lose track of the technical growth which motivates me and gives me security that I'm preparing myself for the future. 

There are many benefits to being a tech lead:
- view of the whole project
- a feeling of ownership
- deeper collaboration with PM and leadership
- increased opportunity for cross-company cooperation
- more time for mentorship

However, there are also a few downsides for me and the way my brain works. I have drastically less time and mental energy for open-ended, "explore" time for coding. Self-directed learning is more focused on the future of the product, rather than my future as an engineer.  

Part of the deal with being an engineer is that you never actually leave "school". Yes, I've graduated, but that just means I have to do my learning outside of work. It takes lifelong learning to stay relevant and excel in this career. So I've been working on a few small things over the past few months (in addition to some contracting work with Ground Control Research, my wife's company, and some secret projects) that I'll spend time writing about as I explore the topics. I used to do a lot more of these before I became tech lead.

## Basic CS Fundamentals
I'm trying to master/freshen up on the basics of CS: Data structures, Algorithms, and design patterns ("Gang of Four" book for example). LeetCode, Advent of Code, online learning courses and certain conference talks align with this. If I hear an interesting topic on one of the coding podcasts that I listen to, I would love to remember it here. 

## C++ Mastery
When I learn new things about the language or broader CS topics, I want to share it here. I especially want to share interesting conference talks that I watch, or things I learn from "Elements of Programming" or whatever.

## Web Development
I've been going through the `FullStackOpen` course from a university in Helsinki (I think?) to help me get more experience with how web apps work and enable me to make my own - audio related or otherwise.

## iOS App Development
I created the Elev8tr app for iOS to enable and keep track of a specific self-improvement strategy, but I haven't updated it since i created a bare bones version. I want to flesh it out and actually release it on the app store. In addition, I want to become more familiar with Swift and SwiftUI.

## DSP and Math Study 
I want to deepen my understanding of DSP fundaments and underlying mathematics. When I learn something new, I want to share/demonstrate here. In addition, I want to keep up with the current state of the art for DSP, ML or otherwise. I expect to discuss research papers that I find interesting. 

## AI Learning
I want to stay up to date with AI and ML technologies, from both the user and engineer angles. Under this umbrella, I want to explore GPU and parallel programming more. I have started a CUDA, course on NVIDIA's developer website, but I haven't followed up since completed the first section. This feels like an area that could be brought into audio that most other audio folks don't have experience with. 

## Misc
I have many other interests, so I want to use this place as a journal to share anything else interesting I may come across. I've become bored with social media, and I never was very good at that anyway. Maybe if I have a place that's designed for me to learn/practice/share, I will be more willing to invest my creative energy. (Also, I vibe with going back towards the early internet where people had their own sites filled with their interests, not centralized on one platform.)

I hope future me looks back on this post as the first of at least some.
